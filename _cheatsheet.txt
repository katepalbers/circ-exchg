IMAGES:
---------------------------------

<figure class="_______">
	<img src="../assets/images/__________.jpg" alt="__________" />
	<figcaption>
		____________________________
	</figcaption>
</figure>

Figures use basic HTML. Copy and paste the above template, and fill in the blanks. The alt="___" text is a short name for the image in case it doesn't load. The class="___" text can be one of three values:

	class="figure": Goes full-width of text column
	class="figure-lg":  Goes full-width of browser window
	class="figure-md":  Goes 70% the width of text column and centers within it
	class="figure-sm": Goes small and to the right of the text column

For the caption (<figcaption>) Text can be formatted and contain links, however, it needs to be formatted as HTML rather than Markdown:

	<em>Italic Text</em>
	<strong>Bold Text</strong>
	<a href="http://www.linkadress.com">Link Text</a>

Image files themselves go in the assets > images folder

RE-SIZING IMAGES FOR THE WEB:
---------------------------------

1. Put any number of images in assets/images/originals
2. Open a new Terminal window (Applications/Utilities/Terminal)
3. Copy and paste, and hit enter:
	
	convert circ-exchg/assets/images/originals/* -colorspace RGB -quality 60%  -set filename:name "%t" circ-exchg/assets/images/webready/%[filename:name].jpg

4. Move re-sized images from the images/webready folder to wherever you need them, DELETE/REMOVE images from images/originals folder

This converts all images, regardless of format, to JPGs with a quality/file-size setting appropriate for the web. It maintains the original image dimensions, and the original file name. 

Note: There cannot be multiple files in images/originals that have the same name and different extenstions. They will overwrite eachother. Also, previsously processed images added to images/originals will be copied into images/webready but will not be further downsampled.



NEW POSTS:
--------------------

New posts start in the _drafts folder, and must follow a naming convention, with the date first, in the following format. The title that follows the date will be used in contructing the URL for the post, and should contain no hyphens: YYYY-MM-DD-shorttitlehere.md

At the top of each post is a required block of metdata (YAML) that appears between two lines of three dashes ---. The layout and category always remain the same, and date and title are required. Update the other lines for each post. The thumbnail should be the complete file name of an image that is in the images folder, and will determine the thumbnail image appearing with the post title on the home page.

Template YAML metadata block:

---
layout: post
category: articles
title: Your Title Here
subtitle: Your Subtitle Here
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: Kate Palmer Albers
thumbnail: _________.jpg
platform:
theme:
---


DATE CHANGES:
--------------------

Remember: When you update the date of the post to coincide with the actual publication date, it should be done in the text of the post AND in the file name itself.



SITE PREVIEW:
--------------------
1. Open Applications > Utilities > Terminal
2. Type "cd /Users/kpalbers/circ-exchg" without the quotes and hit enter
3. Type "bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl '' --drafts" without the quotes and hit enter
4. Open a browser and go to: http://localhost:4000

The preview site will automatically be updated when you save changes to documents in the site, but you need to refresh to see them. Hit Control-C or close the Terminal window to stop the site preview.

To preview a version of the site without any draft posts included, use the command "bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''", after stopping the current site preview with Control-C or by closing the Terminal and starting a new session.
