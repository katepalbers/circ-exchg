I always enjoy seeing what [Paul Paper](www.itismyparty.org/) is up to. We got in touch first because he put together an exhibition on Snapchat, which I thought was brilliant, and wished I'd done myself (and I wrote about [here](http://circulationexchange.org/articles/digital_materiality.html). 

And now he's organized both an exhibition and a publication by the same name, *New Tools in Photography: from Google to Algorithm*.

The exhibition features the work of Aaron Hegert, James Bridle, Esther Hovers, Mantas Grigaitis, and Penelope Umbrico, and is on view at the Vilnius Photography Gallery, in Lithuania, through October 13, 2018. 

The publication features an expanded range of artists in a special issue of the journal *Fotografija*, also based in Vilinus, Lithuania. Paul asked me to contribute an essay, and I was happy to write “Hiding in Plain Sight: Mistakes, Mishaps, and Possibility in Algorithmic Vision”. 
The essay gave me a chance to think about the artists Jenny Odell, Aaron Hegert, Zachary Norman, Thomas Albdorf, and Indré Šerpytytė. I wrote: *The work that artists are doing around questions of human and computer vision working in tandem, in exchange, or even, potentially, in modes of collaboration, suggests that these relationships might be playful, or confrontational, or characterized by an idea about the potentials of mutual curiosity or mutual problem solving.*

*from the essay*

**Jenny Odell**
As humans talk more and more with images, creating visual conversational structures that range from banal banter to poetic observation, saucy exchange to visual kiss-offs, and sly asides to elaborate, ongoing inside jokes, Odell’s conversation with Google, over time, reveals a certain insight into the structure and logic of computer vision. 

**Aaron Hegert**
The artist Aaron Hegert introduces a more contained version of this algorithmic guessing game, bringing it distinctly within the realm of the photographic. In his recent series *Shallow Learning*, Hegert similarly engages with a kind of collaborative approach toward understanding, or, at least, visualizing, how algorithms “see” unfamiliar photographic images....Offered an image it has not “seen” before, how will the program respond? Like Odell’s game, Shallow Learning is built on the promise of a mistake, a necessary failure in the generative, if sometimes slow, processes of curiosity and seeking to understand.  

In his series *Endangered Data*, **Zachary Norman** determined to embed the scientific data readings from measurement stations around the world into the data of photographic images of those stations’ locations. He refers to this embedded data as a form of cryptography known as steganography, a practice in which coded information is hidden within visual images. This is an appealing analogy for all manner of photography and photographic interpretation, but Norman’s use of it is precise, and specifically geared around a critique of the current U.S. political administration’s approach to the extensive array of publicly accessible datasets of scientific measurement of greenhouse gases, an approach that appears to range from cavalier, at best, to intentionally destructive, at worst. By preserving this newly vulnerable data within the framework of photographic images—but in hidden form—Norman’s cryptographic efforts serve as a form of potentially crucial, and creative, preservation of information. 

**Thomas Albdorf’s** *General View* takes a certain pleasure in further confusing the irrational mistakes or errors of coding, mishaps that, expected though they are, still provide an entryway into the foibles of what might otherwise (and rightly) be considered a system closed to such idiosyncratic allowance... Since at least the 1970s, it has been a challenge for photographers who care about originality to see Yosemite as a subject, and many have addressed its photographic legacy as subject. Albdorf updates the creative possibilities of photographic engagement with Yosemite as a site of collective vision by taking the new algorithmic view into account. This view, it turns out, counterintuitively offers a more unique view than the human collective, making it a (perhaps surprisingly) nimble and inventive collaborator. Albdorf’s imagery, over and over, maintains and extends the puzzle and confusion of what it means to see, in the first place, an effect all the more striking for its location in one of the most “seen” places on earth. 

In 2 Seconds of Color, Indré Šerpytytė imagines a space to linger on the long arc of inhumane photographic representation. Fittingly, the space is provided by the lag-time glitch of Google image search; Šerpytytė extends this moment of pause, holding in suspension for the viewer the moment between entering a search term—“Isis beheadings”—and the inevitable grisly results. It is a moment so fleeting as typically to be missed entirely, but a slow or otherwise poor connection provides something other than the expected and sought-after “results”. 2 Seconds of Color finds a new way to ask: What is it we are looking for, and why?
