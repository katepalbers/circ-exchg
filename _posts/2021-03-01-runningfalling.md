Ever since I came across [*27 Contexts: An Anecdotal History in Photography*](https://www.saintlucybooks.com/shop/p/h3oaar1buto624t0seccpuujbq0eef) while browsing in Photo-eye Bookstore, I have been a big fan of the artist Mark Alice Durant's writing on photography. So it is a treat to be included in his latest edited publication, [*Running, Falling, Flying, Floating, Crawling*](https://www.saintlucybooks.com/shop/p/h3oaar1buto624t0seccpuujbq0eef-4sg38-rhsxx) (2020, Saint Lucy Books). Writers were paired with photographs depicting one of those five states of being -- as Durant described it: the book "is a loose compendium of photographs and texts that picture, examine, explore, and / or suggest the human body in states of abandon, helplessness, terror, subjugation, serenity, and transcendence."

I, happily, got to dwell on probably the most iconic photograph I've ever written about: [Harry Callahan's photograph of his wife Eleanor, in 1949](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/48484). 

Becuase of the spirit of the prompt, I didn't have to pretend to be a Callahan expert, but instead reflected on my own experiences of floating, memory, trust, what can be photographed, what can't be, and empathy through an image. 

The book is beautiful, and beautifully done, and I'm happy to be part of it. Check it out, and [spend some time on the Saint Lucy site](https://www.saintlucybooks.com/about) while you're at it.
