Kate Palmer Albers is an Associate Professor of Art History at Whittier College in Los Angeles, where she teaches courses on visual culture, new media, contemporary art, and history and theory of photography.

Her current research focuses on the role of ephemerality throughout the history of photography. The concept of ephemerality encompasses artists’ projects that engage with popular modes of contemporary media technology within a deeply networked culture (GPS, Twitter, virtual reality, GIFs, data storage, the community-based and democratic promises of Wikipedia, etc.) and extends back through to the earliest days of the medium, offering a counterpoint to the predominant theoretical modes of understanding the medium.

Albers has an ongoing interests, as well, in the intersection of photography, geolocational technology, and landscape representations; the roles of narrative, biography, and archive in relation to visual art; and emerging digital technologies and digital humanities approaches in art historical research and student learning.
